## About Me

My name is Olivia Figueira and I am a senior Computer Science and Engineering major with minors in Mathematics and Economics at [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/) in Santa Clara, California, graduating in 2021. When it comes to research, I am interested in the fields of security and privacy, accessibility, artificial intelligence, and computing for social benefit. In Summer 2020, I am participating in the virtual CRA-WP DREU Program at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/).

## About My Mentors

My mentors are Dr. Gang Wang and Dr. Dakshita Khurana at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/). 

Dr. Wang's research covers a range of topics in Security and Privacy, Internet Measurement, Mobile Networks, and HCI, mostly from data-driven perspectives. Learn more about Dr. Wang's work [here](https://gangw.cs.illinois.edu/).

Dr. Khurana's research focuses on Cryptography and the foundations of Security, and more broadly in Theoretical Computer Science. Learn more about Dr. Khurana's work [here](https://www.dakshitakhurana.com/).
