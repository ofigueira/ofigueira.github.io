Prior to starting my DREU virtual program at UIUC, I met with my two mentors to discuss project ideas. I decided on a deep fake generation project, and on Monday of my frist week, we met again and discussed next steps. I began reading papers on the subject prior work that has been done so that I would be ready on Wednesday to meet the rest of the group, inlcuding 3 PhD students, and discuss next steps for the project as a whole. In addition, I attended one of the REU program events on networking and learned about how networking plays a role in graduate school and beyond.
