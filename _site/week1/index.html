  <h1>Week 1</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>Prior to starting my DREU virtual program at UIUC, I met with my two mentors to discuss project ideas. I decided on a deep fake generation project, and on Monday of my first week, we met again and discussed next steps. I began reading papers on the subject prior work that has been done so that I would be ready on Wednesday to meet the rest of the group, including three PhD students, and discuss next steps for the project as a whole.</p>

<p>In addition, I attended the weekly REU Lunch &amp; Learn event on networking and learned about how networking plays a role in graduate school and beyond. It was a great event to learn about networking and how that is an important skill to cultivate and practice early on.</p>

<p>For the rest of the week, I explored some open-source methods for deep-fake generation for us to possibly use in our project. I worked on trying to run them locally to get a sense of how they worked, and also to see if they could be used for our purposes in terms of generating specific styles within images. I will soon gain access to the lab’s servers to run these on their GPUs since deep learning for image generation is computationally intensive.</p>

<p>It was a great start to the program, and I am excited to learn more!</p>
