    <meta name="description" content="This week I attended a meeting with the entire lab of my project mentor, Dr. Wang. The meeting was at 7am PDT, since that is 9am CT, so this is an aspect of virtual DREU participation that I had not thought about until Monday when I had the meeting, but it went well despite how early the meeting was! I met other PhD students in Dr. Wang’s lab and another undergraduate research assistant who will be working on another project this summer.
